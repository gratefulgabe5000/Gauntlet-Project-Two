- **Problem:** Coordinating across 3+ time zones
- **Impact:** Difficult to identify urgent vs. non-urgent overnight messages
- **Current State:** 15+ minutes to catch up each morning
- **Root Cause:** No priority-based message classification

**4. Decision Tracking**
- **Problem:** Losing track of what was decided and why
- **Impact:** New team members ask same questions repeatedly
- **Current State:** 20+ minutes to find past decisions
- **Root Cause:** Decisions scattered across threads, no centralized log
