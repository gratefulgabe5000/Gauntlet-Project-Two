# Phase 3.4: Multi-Step Agent Testing Plan
**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** Testing Phase  
**Tester:** AI Assistant + User

---

## Test Overview

**Goal:** Verify that the Conversation Intelligence Agent works end-to-end, autonomously calling tools and synthesizing results.

**Components to Test:**
1. Agent Cloud Function (backend)
2. Agent service (app-side)
3. AgentProgress component (UI)
4. Agent trigger detection (routing)
5. Tool execution (all 6 tools)
6. Multi-step reasoning
7. Error handling

---

## Test Environment

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ All Cloud Functions deployed
- ✅ App running on physical device or emulator
- ✅ WiFi connected (both phone and dev computer on same network)
- ✅ User authenticated
- ✅ Existing conversations with messages

**Test Device:**
- Platform: Android/iOS
- Connection: WiFi
- Auth: Firebase Authentication
- Data: Existing conversations from prior phases

---

## Test Cases

### **Test Case 1: Simple Priority Query**
**Objective:** Test basic agent functionality with a single tool

**Steps:**
1. Open AI Assistant tab
2. Type: "What are my priorities?"
3. Send message

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Agent trigger detected (routes to agent)
- ✅ AgentProgress component appears
- ✅ Shows "Analyzing your question..."
- ✅ Calls `getPriorityMessages` tool
- ✅ Shows progress: "Finding priorities"
- ✅ Shows result count (e.g., "Found 5 priority messages")
- ✅ Synthesizes final answer
- ✅ Answer includes specific priorities with context
- ✅ Progress clears after 2 seconds

**Pass Criteria:**
- Agent completes in < 30 seconds
- No errors in console
- Response is relevant and actionable
- UI updates smoothly

---

### **Test Case 2: Multi-Step Query (Complex)**
**Objective:** Test agent's multi-step reasoning across multiple tools

**Steps:**
1. Open AI Assistant tab
2. Type: "What are my priorities and what action items do I have?"
3. Send message

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Agent trigger detected
- ✅ AgentProgress shows multiple tool calls:
  1. `getPriorityMessages` - Finding priorities
  2. `getConversationActionItems` - Extracting action items
- ✅ Each tool shows success checkmark
- ✅ Shows result counts for each tool
- ✅ Iteration counter increases (Step 1/5, Step 2/5, etc.)
- ✅ Final answer combines both priorities AND action items
- ✅ Answer is well-structured and coherent

**Pass Criteria:**
- Agent uses 2+ tools
- Tools execute in logical sequence
- No duplicate tool calls
- Final answer synthesizes all tool results

---

### **Test Case 3: Search Query**
**Objective:** Test agent with semantic search tool

**Steps:**
1. Open AI Assistant tab
2. Type: "What decisions were made about the budget?"
3. Send message

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Agent trigger detected ("decisions")
- ✅ Calls `searchAllConversations` with query "budget"
- ✅ Shows "Searching messages"
- ✅ If results found, calls `getConversationDecisions`
- ✅ Shows "Tracking decisions"
- ✅ Final answer lists decisions with context
- ✅ Cites specific conversations/participants

**Pass Criteria:**
- Semantic search returns relevant results
- Agent extracts decisions from found conversations
- Answer includes sources (conversation names, participants)

---

### **Test Case 4: Conversation Summary Request**
**Objective:** Test agent summarization capabilities

**Steps:**
1. Open AI Assistant tab
2. Type: "Analyze my conversations"
3. Send message

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Agent trigger detected ("analyze")
- ✅ Calls `getUserConversations` to get conversation list
- ✅ Shows "Getting conversations"
- ✅ Selects key conversations to analyze
- ✅ Calls `summarizeConversation` for important ones
- ✅ Shows "Generating summary" for each
- ✅ Final answer provides overview of conversations
- ✅ Highlights key themes, participants, or topics

**Pass Criteria:**
- Agent gets conversation list first
- Smartly selects which to summarize (doesn't try to summarize all)
- Summaries are concise and relevant

---

### **Test Case 5: Non-Agent Query (Regular Chat)**
**Objective:** Verify regular chat still works and agent doesn't interfere

**Steps:**
1. Open AI Assistant tab
2. Type: "Hello, how are you?"
3. Send message

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Agent trigger NOT detected
- ✅ Routes to regular `generateAIChatResponse`
- ✅ No AgentProgress component shown
- ✅ Regular typing indicator appears
- ✅ Response is conversational, not tool-based

**Pass Criteria:**
- Agent does not activate
- Regular AI chat responds normally
- No tool calls made

---

### **Test Case 6: Error Handling**
**Objective:** Test agent behavior when tools fail

**Setup:**
1. Turn off WiFi OR
2. Provide query with no relevant data

**Steps:**
1. Open AI Assistant tab
2. Type: "What are my priorities?" (with WiFi off)
3. Send message

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Agent attempts to run
- ✅ Tool call fails (network error)
- ✅ Error shown in AgentProgress
- ✅ Error message displayed to user
- ✅ No app crash
- ✅ User can retry

**Pass Criteria:**
- Graceful error handling
- User-friendly error message
- App remains functional

---

### **Test Case 7: Maximum Iterations**
**Objective:** Verify agent doesn't loop infinitely

**Steps:**
1. Open AI Assistant tab
2. Type a very complex query that might require many tools
3. Send message

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Agent processes query
- ✅ Makes multiple tool calls
- ✅ Stops at maxIterations (5)
- ✅ Provides best answer possible with available data
- ✅ Progress bar reaches 100%

**Pass Criteria:**
- Agent stops after 5 iterations max
- No infinite loops
- Provides answer even if incomplete

---

### **Test Case 8: Empty Results**
**Objective:** Test agent when no data is found

**Steps:**
1. Open AI Assistant tab
2. Type: "What are my priorities?" (in account with no priority messages)
3. Send message

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Agent runs normally
- ✅ Calls `getPriorityMessages`
- ✅ Tool returns 0 results
- ✅ Agent acknowledges no priorities found
- ✅ Provides helpful suggestion (e.g., "You have no urgent messages")

**Pass Criteria:**
- Handles empty results gracefully
- Doesn't error on zero results
- Provides meaningful response

## Performance Benchmarks

**Target Performance:**
- Single tool query: < 10 seconds
- Multi-tool query (2-3 tools): < 20 seconds
- Complex query (4-5 tools): < 30 seconds
- Progress updates: Real-time (<500ms delay)
- UI rendering: 60 FPS, no jank

**Acceptable Performance:**
- Single tool: < 15 seconds
- Multi-tool: < 30 seconds
- Complex: < 45 seconds

**Unacceptable (Needs Optimization):**
- Any query > 60 seconds
- Progress updates > 2 second delay
- UI jank or freezing

2. No way to explicitly force agent mode (auto-detection only)
3. No cancel button during agent execution
4. Tool execution is sequential (not parallel)
5. Progress updates are simulated (not true real-time from backend)

**Future Enhancements:**
