## 5. Identified Gaps & Areas for Enhancement

### 5.1 CRITICAL GAPS ‚ö†Ô∏è (Must Address Before Development)

#### Gap 1: Rubric Not Yet Reviewed

**Issue:** The user mentioned "I will provide the RUBRIC later" - the PRD was created before seeing the actual rubric.

**Risk:** Medium-High

- The PRD targets "95+/105 points" but the actual rubric may have different point allocations
- Specific rubric criteria may not be addressed

**Recommendation:**

- Review actual rubric when provided
- Create rubric alignment matrix
- Adjust PRD priorities based on actual point values
- Update "Rubric Alignment Strategy" section

---

#### Gap 2: Media Support Specification

**Assignment Requirement:** "Include basic media support‚Äîat minimum, users should be able to send and receive images."

**PRD Coverage:** ‚ö†Ô∏è INCOMPLETE

- Message data model includes `mediaUrl` and `mediaType` fields ‚úÖ
- Dependencies include `expo-image-picker` and `expo-image-manipulator` ‚úÖ
- BUT: No explicit task in Phase 1 for image sending/receiving
- No time estimate allocated
- No implementation details provided

**Impact:** This is an MVP requirement that could be missed

**Recommendation:**

- Add explicit task to Phase 1: "Image message support (2h)"
- Add to Day 2 afternoon schedule
- Include in MVP success criteria
- Add test case: "Send image from Device A ‚Üí appears on Device B"

---

#### Gap 3: Typing Indicators Specification

**Assignment Requirement:** "Show when users are typing."

**PRD Coverage:** ‚ö†Ô∏è INCOMPLETE

- Mentioned in Phase 4 (Polish) as "Typing indicators (2h)"
- BUT: Assignment lists this under "Essential Features" for core messaging

**Impact:** May be expected earlier than Phase 4

**Recommendation:**

- Clarify if typing indicators are MVP or polish feature
- If MVP: Move to Phase 1, Day 2
- If polish: Keep in Phase 4 but note as "nice-to-have"

---

### 5.2 MODERATE GAPS ‚ö†Ô∏è (Should Address)

#### Gap 4: Profile Pictures Implementation

**Assignment Requirement:** "Add profile pictures and display names."

**PRD Coverage:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL

- User data model includes `avatarUrl` field ‚úÖ
- Dependencies include `expo-image-picker` ‚úÖ
- Phase 1 includes "User profiles (display name, avatar)" - 2h ‚úÖ
- BUT: No implementation details for profile picture upload/storage

**Recommendation:**

- Add Firebase Storage implementation details
- Specify image compression strategy
- Add to Day 1 tasks explicitly

---

#### Gap 5: Message Delivery States

**Assignment Requirement:** "Handle message delivery states: sending, sent, delivered, read."

**PRD Coverage:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL

- Message data model includes `status: 'sending' | 'sent' | 'delivered' | 'read'` ‚úÖ
- Optimistic UI updates mentioned ‚úÖ
- Read receipts implemented ‚úÖ
- BUT: No explicit implementation for "delivered" state (distinct from "sent")

**Recommendation:**

- Clarify distinction between "sent" (server received) and "delivered" (recipient device received)
- Add Firestore listener logic for delivery confirmation
- Update Message data model documentation

---

#### Gap 6: AI Feature Testing with Edge Cases

**Assignment Requirement:** "Test with edge cases (empty conversations, mixed languages, etc.)"

**PRD Coverage:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL

- Each AI feature has test cases ‚úÖ
- Some edge cases mentioned (e.g., "Handle empty conversation gracefully")
- BUT: No comprehensive edge case testing plan

**Recommendation:**

- Add dedicated "AI Edge Case Testing" section
- Include test cases for:
  - Empty conversations
  - Very long conversations (1000+ messages)
  - Mixed languages
  - Emoji-only messages
  - Code snippets in messages
  - Special characters
- Add to Day 4 evening schedule

---

#### Gap 7: AI Response Caching Strategy

**Assignment Recommendation:** "Cache common AI responses to reduce costs"
