Take a look at the other tab called "Just Saying Hello" and refresh your memory on everything that we've done so far. Then go ahead and pick up exactly where you were.

I'll help you refresh my memory by looking at the "Just Saying Hello" tab and then continue from where we left off. Let me first examine the current project structure and then search for any relevant information about our previous work.


I can see the current project structure, but I don't have access to the "Just Saying Hello" tab you mentioned. However, I can see this is a fresh Node.js project workspace called "GratefulGabe5000" with basic configuration files set up.

Let me search for any existing code or files that might give me clues about what we were working on:


I can see that we have a basic Node.js project setup with `package.json` and `README.md`, but there are no actual code files yet. Since I can't access the "Just Saying Hello" tab directly, could you help me understand what we were working on? 

Based on the project name "GratefulGabe5000" and the fact that you mentioned "Just Saying Hello", it sounds like we might have been working on a simple greeting application or website. 

Could you tell me:
1. What type of project we were building?
2. What specific features or functionality we had implemented or were planning to implement?
3. What the current state was when we left off?

This will help me pick up exactly where we left off and continue the development seamlessly.

Take a look in the prior chats folder for 2025.10.12.001 cursor Just Saying Hello.md file to review our last chat.

I'll look for the prior chat file you mentioned to review our previous conversation.


Great! I found the chat file. Let me read it to understand what we were working on.


Perfect! Now I can see exactly where we left off. Based on the chat history, we were setting up your Cursor development environment and I was about to install Node.js and Docker Desktop using Windows Package Manager (winget). The installation process was interrupted, so let me pick up exactly where we left off.
