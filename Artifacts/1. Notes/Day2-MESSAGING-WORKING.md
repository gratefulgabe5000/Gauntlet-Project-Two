## 🔧 Final Solution

### MessageInput Component (Completely Rewritten):
```typescript
// Simple, bulletproof pattern
- Single View container
- TextInput for message
- TouchableOpacity button with "SEND" text
- SafeAreaInsets for Android nav bar
- ~70 lines total (was ~110)
```

### Conversation Screen:
```typescript
// KeyboardAvoidingView wraps everything
- Handles keyboard properly
- Doesn't interfere with touch events
- Input moves up with keyboard
```

## 🎯 Key Learnings

### What Worked:
1. **Systematic debugging** - Added logs at each layer
2. **Test buttons** - Used working buttons to isolate issue
3. **Complete rewrite** - Sometimes simpler is better
4. **SafeAreaInsets** - Essential for Android
5. **Parent-level KeyboardAvoidingView** - Don't put in child components

### What Didn't Work:
1. Hot reload for touch event fixes
2. Complex wrapper Views
3. Pressable component (in this case)
4. KeyboardAvoidingView inside MessageInput
5. Multiple z-index attempts without addressing root cause

### Critical Insights:
1. **Touch events** are fragile - keep structure simple
2. **Android nav bar** must be accounted for with SafeAreaInsets
3. **KeyboardAvoidingView** should wrap entire screen, not components
4. **Hot reload** doesn't always work for event handlers
5. **When stuck** - rewrite from scratch with proven pattern
