5. Tap a result ‚Üí navigate to conversation
6. Show message highlighted/in context

**Narration:**
"Feature three is Smart Search with AI query expansion. Watch what happens when I search for 'meeting'. The AI expands my query to include synonyms: call, sync, standup, discussion. So I get results even when people used different words to mean the same thing. Each result shows the message in context, and I can tap to jump directly to that conversation. This is way more powerful than basic keyword search."

**Key Visual Callouts:**
- Search bar
- "Expanded query" text
- Results with conversation context
- Navigation to message

6. Watch AI automatically detect and mark as urgent (üö®)

**Narration:**
"Feature four runs automatically on every message - Priority Detection. See these colored dots? Red for urgent, orange for high priority, green for normal, gray for low priority. I can filter my conversations by priority level. Now watch this - I'll send a message that says 'URGENT: Server is down!' The AI instantly detects the urgency and marks it with the red urgent indicator. No manual tagging needed - it happens automatically. On Android, this even uses priority-specific notification channels for better notification management."

**Key Visual Callouts:**
- Priority dots on conversations
- Filter dropdown menu
- Real-time priority assignment

**Narration:**
"The fifth AI feature is Decision Tracking. When teams make decisions in conversations, they often get lost in the chat history. This feature extracts those decisions and organizes them in a timeline. Each card shows the decision, who made it, when, the reasoning, and impact level. Decisions are categorized as strategic, tactical, or operational, with confidence scores. And you can navigate back to the original message for full context. This creates a permanent record of important decisions."

**Key Visual Callouts:**
- Decision cards with metadata
- Category badges
- Confidence scores
- "View Message" navigation

### **SCENE 8: Advanced AI - Semantic Search (RAG)** (45 seconds)
**Visual:** Most impressive part - show the power of RAG

**Actions:**
1. Go to AI Assistant
2. Navigate to settings or migration screen
3. Show "Index Existing Messages to Pinecone" button
4. (If not already done) Tap to trigger migration
5. Show migration stats: "Indexed: 127, Skipped: 5 encrypted"
6. Now demonstrate semantic search:
   - Search: "machine learning" ‚Üí find "AI" and "neural networks"
   - Search: "schedule" ‚Üí find "calendar", "appointment", "time"
7. Show results with relevance scores
8. Explain vector search vs keyword search

**Narration:**
"Now, the advanced feature that goes beyond the requirements - Semantic Search using Retrieval Augmented Generation. First, I needed to index all existing messages to Pinecone's vector database. This converts each message into a 1536-dimensional vector embedding using OpenAI's embedding model. The system indexed 127 messages and skipped 5 encrypted ones for privacy. Now here's where it gets really impressive. Traditional keyword search only finds exact matches. But semantic search understands meaning. When I search for 'machine learning', it finds discussions about 'AI', 'neural networks', and 'artificial intelligence' - even though those exact words weren't in my query. Another example - search for 'schedule' and it finds 'calendar', 'appointment', 'meeting time' - all semantically related concepts. This uses Pinecone's vector similarity search with cosine similarity to find content that means the same thing, not just contains the same words. It's a huge upgrade in search capability."

**Key Visual Callouts:**
- Migration stats
- Pinecone logo/mention
- Vector embeddings concept (maybe show diagram)
- Relevance scores on results
- Semantic matches (different words, same meaning)
