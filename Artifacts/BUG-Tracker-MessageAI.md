## 🐛 FUNCTIONAL BUGS (Priority Ordered)

### BUG-004: Login Not Persistent & Accidental App Exit ✅ FIXED

**Priority:** Critical (was 🔴)  
**Category:** Authentication/Navigation  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Discovered:** October 21, 2025  
**Fixed:** October 21, 2025  
**Component:** Auth Service & Navigation Flow  
**Actual Fix Time:** 45 minutes

**Description:**
This is a critical dual-issue bug that significantly impacts user experience:

**Issue 1 - Login Not Persistent:**
User authentication sessions are not persisting on the device. When the app is closed (even momentarily) or the user navigates away, the authentication state is lost. Users are forced to re-login every single time they return to the app, which is extremely frustrating and breaks expected mobile app behavior.

**Issue 2 - Back Button Exits Too Easily:**
The back button behavior on the main Messages screen exits the application to the welcome/login screen with a single press. It should require a double-press (or confirmation) to exit, preventing accidental logouts. This is standard Android app behavior to prevent inadvertent exits.

**Combined Impact:**
These two issues together create a highly frustrating experience: users accidentally press back once, get kicked to login screen, and then have to log in again. This can happen multiple times in a single session.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Login to the app successfully
2. Navigate to Messages/Conversations screen
3. Close the app completely (swipe away or press home)
4. Reopen the app
5. Observe: User is back at login screen (should still be logged in)

OR

1. Login to the app successfully
2. Navigate to Messages/Conversations screen
3. Press back button once
4. Observe: App exits to welcome/login screen (should require double-press)

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Auth Persistence:** User login should persist across app sessions using secure storage (AsyncStorage, SecureStore, or Firebase auth persistence)
- **Back Button:** Should require double-press to exit from main Messages screen, with toast message like "Press back again to exit"
- **Session Duration:** Users should stay logged in until they explicitly log out

**Actual Behavior:**
- Auth session is not saved; users must login every time
- Single back button press exits app
- Combined effect makes app nearly unusable for real-world use

**Impact:**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Makes app frustrating to use in real scenarios
- Breaks fundamental mobile app expectations
- Users will abandon app due to login friction
- Blocks production readiness
- Significantly degrades demo experience
- High priority fix required before submission

**Possible Solution:**

**For Auth Persistence:**
- Implement Firebase auth persistence (should persist by default)
- Verify `onAuthStateChanged` listener is properly set up in root layout
- Check if auth state is being checked on app initialization
- May need to use React Native's AsyncStorage or Expo SecureStore
- Ensure auth tokens are being stored and retrieved correctly
- Add splash screen while checking auth status

**For Back Button:**
- Implement Android back button handler using `BackHandler` API
- Track back button press timing (detect double-press within 2 seconds)
- Show Toast message: "Press back again to exit"
- Only exit to welcome screen on second press within time window
- Reset timer if user doesn't press back again

**Related Files:**
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Root layout, auth state management
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Tabs layout, may need back handler
- `app/(tabs)/conversations.tsx` - Main screen where back should be handled
- `src/services/firebase/authService.ts` - Auth service configuration
- May need to add: `src/hooks/useBackHandler.ts`

**Technical Notes:**
- Firebase auth should persist by default - need to investigate why it's not
- Check if auth listener is cleaning up incorrectly
- Verify AsyncStorage/SecureStore is available and working
- BackHandler requires Android-specific implementation
- May need platform-specific code (iOS doesn't have back button)

**Priority Justification:**
This is marked as CRITICAL because:
1. It breaks core app functionality (staying logged in)
2. Creates significant user friction
3. Makes app nearly unusable for real-world scenarios
4. Must be fixed before any demo or submission
5. Relatively quick fix (2-3 hours) for massive UX improvement

**Solution Implemented:**

**Issue 1 Fix - Auth Persistence:**
- Added `onAuthStateChanged` listener in root layout (`app/_layout.tsx`)
- Implemented automatic route redirection based on auth state
- Firebase Auth automatically persists sessions via AsyncStorage (built-in)
- App now checks auth state on startup and restores logged-in sessions

**Issue 2 Fix - Back Button Behavior:**
- Implemented double-press-to-exit pattern in `app/(tabs)/conversations.tsx`
- Only active on main conversations screen (Android only)
- First press shows toast: "Press back again to exit"
- Second press within 2 seconds allows exit
- Does not interfere with navigation from other screens

**Files Modified:**
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Added auth state listener and navigation logic
- `app/(tabs)/conversations.tsx` - Added BackHandler for double-press exit

**Testing:**
- ✅ Login persistence verified across app restarts
- ✅ Back button requires double-press on conversations screen
- ✅ Single-press back navigation works normally from conversation to conversations
- ✅ No interference with navigation between other screens
- ✅ In-app navigation buttons work correctly
- ✅ Verified working on both Android and iOS devices

### BUG-005: One-on-One Conversations Show "Unknown" Name ✅ FIXED

**Priority:** High (was 🟠)  
**Category:** Data/Display  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Discovered:** October 21, 2025  
**Fixed:** October 21, 2025  
**Component:** Conversations List & Chat Headers  
**Actual Fix Time:** 30 minutes

**Description:**
In one-on-one (direct message) conversations, the conversation list and chat headers are displaying "Unknown" instead of showing the actual participant's name. This makes it impossible for users to identify who they're chatting with, severely impacting the usability of the messaging feature. Users cannot distinguish between different conversations without opening them and checking message content.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Login to the app
2. Create or open a one-on-one conversation with another user
3. Navigate to the conversations list screen
4. Observe: Conversation shows "Unknown" instead of participant name
5. Open the conversation
6. Observe: Chat header also shows "Unknown" instead of participant name

**Expected Behavior:**
- Conversation list should display the other participant's name (display name or username)
- Chat header should show the other participant's name
- If participant has no name set, should show email or user ID as fallback
- Name should update in real-time if participant changes their profile

**Actual Behavior:**
All one-on-one conversations display "Unknown" as the conversation/participant name, making conversations indistinguishable from each other.

**Impact:**
- High priority UX issue
- Users cannot identify who they're talking to
- Makes multi-conversation management impossible
- Severely degrades messaging experience
- Affects demo quality significantly
- Not blocking but highly visible bug

**Possible Causes:**
- User profile data not being fetched for conversation participants
- Incorrect field mapping (e.g., looking for wrong property name)
- Participant lookup logic failing silently
- Database query not joining user profile data
- Real-time listener not subscribed to user profile updates

**Possible Solution:**
- Check conversation data structure and participant ID storage
- Verify user profile fetching logic in conversation service
- Implement proper user data lookup for each conversation participant
- Add fallback logic: displayName → username → email → "User [ID]"
- Ensure real-time listener updates when user profiles change
- Cache user profile data to reduce repeated fetches
- Add error handling and logging for failed user lookups

**Related Files:**
- `app/(tabs)/conversations.tsx` - Conversation list rendering
- `app/conversation/[id].tsx` - Individual conversation header
- `src/services/firebase/conversationService.ts` - Conversation data fetching
- `src/services/firebase/userService.ts` - User profile fetching (may need to create)
- `src/types/index.ts` - Type definitions for User and Conversation

**Technical Notes:**
- Need to fetch user profiles for conversation participants
- One-on-one conversations: filter out current user, show other participant
- May need to join user collection data with conversation data
- Consider creating a `getUserProfile(userId)` utility function
- Implement proper null/undefined checks and fallbacks

**Debug Checklist:**
- [ ] Check what data is in conversation.participants array
- [ ] Verify participant IDs are correct
- [ ] Check if user profile data exists in database
- [ ] Test if user profile query is returning data
- [ ] Verify field names match between query and display
- [ ] Check console for any error messages during conversation load

**Solution Implemented:**

**Root Cause:**
The `getConversation()` function was only returning participant IDs, not the full user data with names. The conversation screen and list were trying to display `displayName` from empty participant objects.

**Fix:**
- Updated `app/conversation/[id].tsx` to fetch user data for each participant after loading conversation
- Modified conversation loading logic to populate `conversation.participants` array with full user objects
- Added fallback chain for display names: `displayName → email → uid (first 6 chars) → "Unknown"`
- Ensured participant data is properly fetched and stored before rendering

**Files Modified:**
- `app/conversation/[id].tsx` - Added async user data fetching after getConversation call

**Testing:**
- ✅ One-on-one conversations now show participant names correctly
- ✅ Group chats show participant names
- ✅ Fallback logic works when displayName is missing
- ✅ Real-time updates work properly

### BUG-001: Keyboard Dismissal Causes Misaligned Input Controls ⏸️ DEFERRED

**Priority:** High (Post-MVP)  
**Category:** UI/Layout  
**Status:** ⏸️ Deferred to Post-MVP  
**Discovered:** October 21, 2025  
**Component:** Conversation Screen - Message Input  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Deferred Reason:** Not blocking MVP demo; will address in post-submission polish phase

**Description:**
When entering the text box to send a message, the on-screen keyboard appears and pushes the text input and send button up. However, when the keyboard is dismissed, the input controls do not return to their original position. Instead, they remain partially elevated, creating a visual misalignment and poor UX.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open any conversation
2. Tap on the message input text box
3. Observe keyboard appears and controls move up (expected)
4. Dismiss the keyboard (tap outside or press back)
5. Observe controls move down but not to original position (bug)

**Expected Behavior:**
Input controls should return to their original position at the bottom of the screen when keyboard is dismissed.

**Actual Behavior:**
Input controls remain partially elevated, creating a gap at the bottom and misalignment.

**Impact:**
- Affects core messaging functionality
- Creates poor visual experience
- May confuse users
- Impacts demo quality

**Possible Solution:**
- Review KeyboardAvoidingView configuration
- Implement proper keyboard event listeners
- Ensure layout properly responds to keyboard dismiss events
- Test on both iOS and Android platforms

**Related Files:**
- `app/conversation/[id].tsx`
- May need to adjust layout handling in conversation screen

### BUG-002: Group Chat Missing Participant Avatar Badges ⏸️ DEFERRED

**Priority:** Medium (Post-MVP)  
**Category:** UI/Visual  
**Status:** ⏸️ Deferred to Post-MVP  
**Discovered:** October 21, 2025  
**Component:** Group Chat Header  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Deferred Reason:** Visual enhancement; core group chat functionality works; will polish post-MVP

**Description:**
In group chat conversations, there is no visual representation of all participant avatars at the top of the screen. The header should display stacked/offset avatar badges for each group member (similar to the positioning of the 'create group chat' icon on the main Chats screen), allowing users to quickly identify all participants at a glance.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open any group conversation
2. Look at the top of the screen where chat header/title is
3. Observe only basic group name without participant avatars

**Expected Behavior:**
Group chat header should display stacked/offset avatar images for all participants, with each avatar showing enough of the image to identify the participant. This should be positioned similarly to where the 'create group chat' icon appears on the main Chats screen.

**Actual Behavior:**
No participant avatars are displayed in the group chat header.

**Impact:**
- Missing visual feature for group identification
- Users cannot quickly see who is in the group
- Reduces WhatsApp-like experience
- Not blocking but affects UX quality

**Possible Solution:**
- Create a stacked avatar component
- Implement offset positioning for overlapping avatars
- Limit display to first 3-4 participants with "+N" indicator if more
- Add proper spacing and z-index management
- Ensure avatars are tappable to show full participant list

**Related Files:**
- `app/conversation/[id].tsx` - Group chat header rendering
- May need new component: `src/components/StackedAvatars.tsx`

**References:**
- Similar to "create group chat" icon positioning on main Chats screen
- Common pattern in WhatsApp and other messaging apps

### BUG-003: Group Chat Read Indicators Show Incorrectly ✅ FIXED

**Priority:** High  
**Category:** Logic/Feature  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Discovered:** October 21, 2025  
**Fixed:** October 21, 2025  
**Component:** Group Chat - Read Receipts  
**Actual Fix Time:** 2-3 hours

**Description:**
In group chat conversations, read indicators (checkmarks or "seen" status) were incorrectly displayed when the first participant read the message. The correct behavior is to only show read indicators when ALL participants in the group have read the message, not when just one or a few have seen it. This follows standard messaging app conventions (like WhatsApp) where group read receipts indicate complete group visibility. **This has now been fixed.**

**Steps to Reproduce (Before Fix):**
1. Create a group chat with 3+ participants
2. Send a message as one user
3. Have only one other participant read the message
4. Observed that read indicator appeared immediately (bug)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Read indicators should only appear when ALL group participants have read the message
- Partial reads should not trigger the read indicator
- Should follow WhatsApp convention for group read receipts

**Previous Behavior (Before Fix):**
Read indicator appeared as soon as the first participant read the message, giving false impression that everyone had seen it.

**Current Behavior (After Fix):**
✅ Read indicators now correctly appear only when ALL participants have read the message, excluding the sender from the count.

**Impact (Before Fix):**
- Incorrect read receipt information
- Misleading to users about message visibility
- Affected core messaging UX expectations
- Broke standard messaging app conventions
- Important for group communication clarity

**Impact (After Fix):**
✅ Read receipts now provide accurate information
✅ Users can trust when messages have been seen by all participants
✅ Follows WhatsApp and industry-standard conventions
✅ Improved group communication clarity

**Possible Solution:**
- Update read receipt logic to check all participant read statuses
- Aggregate read receipts: only show "read" when `readBy.length === totalParticipants`
- May need to exclude sender from count
- Consider showing partial read status (e.g., "Read by 2 of 5")
- Update message status calculation in real-time listener

**Related Files:**
- `app/conversation/[id].tsx` - Message rendering and read status display
- `src/services/firebase/messageService.ts` - Read receipt logic
- Message status calculation logic needs review

**Technical Notes:**
- Need to track `readBy` array for each message in group chats
- Compare `readBy.length` against total participant count
- Exclude message sender from read count
- Ensure real-time updates when read status changes

**Resolution:**
✅ **Fixed** - Updated read receipt logic to properly handle group chats:
- Modified message status calculation to check if ALL participants (excluding sender) have read the message
- Updated `readBy` array comparison: now checks `readBy.length === (participants.length - 1)`
- Sender is properly excluded from the count
- Real-time updates working correctly - read indicators update as each participant reads
- Tested with multiple group sizes (3, 4, and 5+ participants)
- Read receipts now follow WhatsApp convention for group chats

**Files Modified:**
- `app/conversation/[id].tsx` - Updated message status rendering logic
- `src/services/firebase/messageService.ts` - Updated read receipt calculation

### LIMIT-001: Push Notifications Not Supported in Expo Go (Android SDK 53+) 📋

**Priority:** Known Limitation  
**Category:** Platform/Environment  
**Status:** Documented  
**Discovered:** October 21, 2025  
**Component:** Push Notifications / expo-notifications  
**Estimated Fix Time:** N/A (Platform limitation, not a code bug)

**Description:**
Push notifications are not supported in Expo Go on Android starting with SDK 53. This is an Expo Go platform limitation, not a bug in the MessageAI codebase. The notification infrastructure has been implemented correctly and will work in:
- **iOS in Expo Go** (Limited support - foreground only)
- **Development builds** (Full support on both platforms)
- **Production apps** (Full support on both platforms)

**Technical Details:**
From Expo documentation and terminal warnings:
```
ERROR expo-notifications: Android Push notifications (remote notifications) 
functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with 
the release of SDK 53. Use a development build instead of Expo Go.
```

**What Was Implemented:**
✅ `expo-notifications` package installed
✅ Notification service created (`src/services/notifications.ts`)
✅ Permission handling implemented
✅ Notification handlers configured in root layout
✅ Message notification triggers added to conversation screen
✅ Support for text and image message notifications
✅ Notification navigation (tap to open conversation)

**Current Behavior:**
- **Android in Expo Go:** No notifications (platform limitation)
- **iOS in Expo Go:** Limited support (may show notifications when app is in foreground)
- **Development Build:** Full notification support expected
- **Production App:** Full notification support expected

**Architecture Issue Noted:**
The current implementation has notifications triggered from the conversation screen's message subscription, which has architectural limitations:
- Notifications only trigger when conversation screen is mounted and subscribed
- Global message listener would be needed for proper notification coverage
- This requires either:
  - Background service (needs development build)
  - Root-level subscription to all conversations
  - Firebase Cloud Functions + FCM (Phase 4 enhancement)

**Impact:**
- Does not block MVP submission
- Notification infrastructure is in place and ready
- Code will work correctly in development builds and production
- Acceptable for MVP demonstration (can explain limitation)
- Enhancement planned for Phase 4

**Resolution Strategy:**
This is accepted as a known limitation for the MVP demo:
1. Notification code is implemented and ready
2. Works in development builds and production
3. Will be demonstrated in documentation/screenshots
4. Enhanced in Phase 4 with:
   - Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side notifications
   - FCM token management
   - Global message subscription architecture
   - Background notification support

**Related Files:**
- `src/services/notifications.ts` - Notification service ✅ Implemented
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Root layout with permission handling ✅ Implemented
- `app/conversation/[id].tsx` - Message notification triggers ✅ Implemented
- `TaskList-MessageAI.md` - Phase 1.16 marked as "Partial - Expo Go limitation"

**Documentation:**
- Limitation documented in TaskList Phase 1.16
- Architecture notes added for Phase 4 enhancement
- Known to require development build for full functionality

**Priority Justification:**
Marked as "Known Limitation" because:
1. Not a code bug - platform restriction
2. Infrastructure correctly implemented
3. Works in target environments (dev build/production)
4. Does not block MVP submission
5. Acceptable for demonstration with explanation
6. Enhancement path clearly defined for Phase 4

  - May need to explain "names will be properly displayed after fix"
  
- **Keyboard interaction in conversations** - Be careful when showing message input
  - Bug: Input controls may not return to correct position after keyboard dismisses

### ⚠️ Recording Considerations
- 🔴 **CRITICAL - Session Management:**
  - **Record entire demo in ONE CONTINUOUS SESSION**
  - Do NOT close or minimize the app during recording
  - Do NOT press back button on main Messages screen
  - Login once at the beginning and keep app open throughout
  - If you need to restart, must login again (frustrating)
  
- **When demonstrating messaging:**
  - Keep keyboard visible or edit in landscape mode
  - Or avoid repeatedly opening/closing keyboard
  - If keyboard bug visible, acknowledge it as "known issue being fixed"
  
- **Group chats:**
  - Group functionality works great! ✅
  - Read receipts now working correctly (fixed!) ✅
  - Avatar display incomplete but not blocking
  - Focus on messaging capabilities and read receipt functionality

- **Conversation names (BUG-005):**
  - One-on-one chats will show "Unknown" as name
  - Verbally narrate who you're chatting with during demo
  - Open each conversation to show messaging works despite wrong name
  - Acknowledge as "known display issue being fixed"

### 💡 Demo Workarounds

- **BUG-004 (Login persistence & back button) - CRITICAL:** 🔴
  - **Login once at start and NEVER close the app**
  - Record entire demo in one continuous take
  - Avoid pressing back button from main screen
  - Don't demonstrate "returning to app" or session management
  - If you must restart: Budget extra time for re-login and setup
  - Consider recording in segments and editing together (login only shown once)
  - **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT WORKAROUND**

- **BUG-005 (Unknown conversation names):** 🟠
  - Verbally identify conversations: "Here I'm chatting with [Name]..."
  - Explain: "The conversation list shows Unknown currently, but messaging works"
  - Focus on actual messaging functionality rather than names
  - Demonstrate that messages are being sent/received correctly
  - Mention: "User names will be properly displayed once this bug is fixed"
  - Consider using chat content to identify conversations

- **BUG-001 (Keyboard layout):**
  - Type message and send without dismissing keyboard first
  - Or restart app between message demonstrations to reset layout
  - Minimize keyboard show/hide cycles during recording

- **BUG-002 (Group avatars):**
  - Verbally explain "group member avatars will be added here"
  - Focus on group messaging functionality which works correctly
  - Show group creation screen which has proper avatar display

### ✅ Features Now Ready to Demo
- **Group chat read receipts** - Now working correctly!
  - Can confidently demonstrate read indicators in group chats

## 🐛 BUG-006: Message Not Highlighted After Search Navigation

**Priority:** 🟢 Low  
**Category:** UI/Visual  
**Status:** ⏸️ Deferred to Phase 4  
**Discovered:** October 23, 2025 (Phase 2.6 Integration Testing)  
**Test Case:** TC-SS-004

### Description
When navigating from search results to a conversation, the target message is not highlighted or visually indicated to the user.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open AI Assistant
2. Perform a search (e.g., "meeting")
3. Tap on a search result
4. Observe the conversation screen

### Expected Behavior
- Message should be highlighted with background color or border
- Visual indication that this is the message from search results
- User can immediately identify the relevant message

### Actual Behavior
- Message is in view and correctly positioned
- No visual highlight or indicator
- User must manually scan to find the relevant message

### Impact
- **Severity:** Low (Nice-to-have feature)
- **User Impact:** Minor inconvenience - user has to visually scan
- **Frequency:** Every search → navigate workflow
- **Workaround:** Message is visible in context, just not highlighted

### Technical Notes
- Need to implement message highlighting feature
- Pass messageId as navigation param
- Apply temporary highlight style (fade after 2-3 seconds)
- Consider scroll + highlight animation

### Estimated Fix Time
**1-2 hours**
- Add highlight state to message component (30 min)
- Implement navigation with messageId param (30 min)
- Add fade-out animation (30 min)
- Test on iOS + Android (30 min)

### Resolution Plan
- Schedule for Phase 4 (Polish & Testing)
- Not blocking Phase 3 (Advanced AI Features)
- Low priority - UX enhancement only

## 💡 ENHANCE-001: Decision Timeline - Scroll to Specific Message

**Priority:** 💡 Enhancement  
**Category:** Feature/UX  
**Status:** ⏸️ Future Enhancement  
**Discovered:** October 24, 2025 (Phase 3.2 Testing)  
**Related Feature:** Decision Tracking (Phase 3.2)

### Description
"View Message" buttons in the Decision Timeline currently navigate to the conversation but don't scroll to or highlight the specific message where the decision was made. This enhancement would add message-specific navigation.

### Current Behavior
1. User taps "View Message" button in Decision Timeline
2. Navigates to the conversation
3. User is at the top of the conversation
4. User must manually scroll to find the decision message

### Desired Behavior
1. User taps "View Message" button in Decision Timeline
2. Navigates to the conversation
3. **Automatically scrolls to the specific message**
4. **Highlights the message temporarily** (e.g., yellow flash/border)
5. User can see the decision in context immediately

### Implementation Notes
**Phase 3.2 (Current):**
- ✅ "View Message" button navigates to conversation
- ✅ `conversationId` is passed
- ❌ `messageId` is NOT passed to the conversation screen
- ❌ No scrolling logic implemented
- ❌ No message highlighting implemented

**Future Implementation:**
1. **Pass messageId as navigation parameter:**
   ```typescript
   router.push({
     pathname: `/conversation/${decision.conversationId}`,
     params: { highlightMessageId: decision.sourceMessageIds[0] }
   });
   ```

2. **Update conversation screen to handle highlight param:**
   - Read `highlightMessageId` from route params
   - Scroll to message using FlatList `scrollToIndex` or `scrollToOffset`
   - Add temporary highlight styling (yellow glow/border)
   - Fade out highlight after 2-3 seconds

3. **Handle edge cases:**
   - Message not found (deleted/encrypted)
   - Message not yet loaded (pagination)
   - Multiple source messages (highlight all or just first?)

### Benefits
- **Better UX:** User immediately sees the decision context
- **Saves time:** No manual scrolling needed
- **Professional feel:** Polished interaction like modern messaging apps
- **Consistency:** Matches similar features (e.g., reply jumps, search results)

### Estimated Implementation Time
- Add messageId to navigation: **15 minutes**
- Implement scroll-to-message logic: **1 hour**
- Add highlight animation: **45 minutes**
- Test edge cases: **30 minutes**
- **Total: 2-3 hours**

### Priority Justification
- **Not blocking:** Current behavior works (navigates to conversation)
- **Nice-to-have:** Enhances UX but not critical
- **Future enhancement:** Can be implemented after MVP/Phase 4
- **Low risk:** Isolated feature, won't impact existing functionality

### Related Code
- `src/components/ai/DecisionTimeline.tsx` - View Message button handler
- `app/conversation/[id].tsx` - Conversation screen (needs update)
- `src/components/messages/MessageList.tsx` - Message rendering (needs highlight)

## 🐛 BUG-008: AI Features Throw Errors When No Results Found

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Category:** Error Handling  
**Status:** ⏸️ Deferred to Phase 4  
**Discovered:** October 24, 2025 (User Testing)  
**Related Features:** Action Item Extraction, Decision Tracking

### Description
AI features (Action Items, Decisions) throw errors when no results are found in a conversation, instead of gracefully handling empty results. Thread Summarization handles this correctly, but needs verification for fully encrypted conversations.

### Steps to Reproduce

**Scenario 1: Action Items - No Actions Found**
1. Open a conversation with only casual chat (no tasks/todos)
2. Tap AI button → "Extract Action Items"
3. Result: Error thrown ❌
4. Expected: "No action items found in this conversation"

**Scenario 2: Decisions - No Decisions Found**
1. Open a conversation with only questions/discussions (no commitments)
2. Tap AI button → "Track Decisions"
3. Result: Error thrown ❌
4. Expected: "No decisions found in this conversation"

**Scenario 3: Fully Encrypted Conversation**
1. Open a conversation where ALL messages are encrypted
2. Tap AI button → "Summarize Thread" (or other features)
3. Result: Unknown (needs verification)
4. Expected: "Cannot analyze encrypted messages" message

### Expected Behavior
- AI features should detect empty/null results from OpenAI
- Display user-friendly message instead of error
- Provide helpful context (e.g., "Try adding tasks to extract action items")
- Thread Summarization already handles this well - use as reference

### Actual Behavior
- JavaScript/TypeScript error thrown
- App may crash or show error screen
- Poor user experience

### Impact
- **Severity:** Medium (UX issue, not a blocker)
- **User Impact:** Moderate - disrupts workflow, confusing error messages
- **Frequency:** Common - many conversations have no action items or decisions
- **Workaround:** User must restart app or navigate away

### Technical Notes

**Fix Required In:**
1. **`functions/src/ai/extractActions.ts`:**
   ```typescript
   // Add check after AI response
   if (!parsedResponse.items || parsedResponse.items.length === 0) {
     return {
       items: [],
       messageCount,
       encryptedCount,
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
       message: "No action items found in this conversation."
     };
   }
   ```

2. **`functions/src/ai/trackDecisions.ts`:**
   ```typescript
   // Add check after AI response
   if (!parsedResponse.decisions || parsedResponse.decisions.length === 0) {
     return {
       decisions: [],
       messageCount,
       encryptedCount,
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
       message: "No decisions found in this conversation."
     };
   }
   ```

3. **`functions/src/ai/summarize.ts`:**
   - Verify fully encrypted conversation handling
   - Should return "Cannot summarize encrypted messages" message

**Client-Side Handling:**
- Update `app/(tabs)/ai-assistant.tsx` to display friendly messages
- Show empty state UI instead of error
- Provide helpful tips for using AI features

### Estimated Fix Time
- Backend error handling: **30 minutes**
- Client-side UI updates: **30 minutes**
- Testing all scenarios: **30 minutes**
- **Total: 1-2 hours**

### Priority Justification
- **Not blocking:** App still works, just poor UX
- **Medium priority:** Affects common use cases
- **Defer to Phase 4:** Polish & error handling phase
- **Good test case:** For comprehensive error handling review

## 💡 ENHANCE-003: Delete Conversations with Participant Agreement

**Priority:** 💡 Enhancement  
**Category:** Feature/UX  
**Status:** ⏸️ Future Enhancement  
**Discovered:** October 24, 2025 (User Request)  
**Related Feature:** Conversation Management

### Description
Allow users to delete entire conversations, with requirement that all participants agree before conversation is permanently deleted.

### Desired Behavior

**1. Single User Delete:**
- User swipes conversation → "Delete" option
- Confirmation: "Delete conversation?"
- Result: Conversation removed from user's list
- Other participants still see conversation
- Firestore: Remove user from `participantIds` array

**2. All Participants Agreement:**
- If all participants delete, conversation is permanently deleted
- Firestore: Delete entire conversation document
- Firestore: Delete all message subcollection documents
- Storage: Delete all associated media files

**3. Conversation Archiving (Alternative):**
- Instead of delete, option to "Archive"
- Archived conversations hidden from main list
- Can be restored from Archive section
- Less destructive than delete

### Implementation Notes

**Firestore Logic:**
```typescript
// When user deletes conversation
1. Remove userId from conversation.participantIds
2. If participantIds.length === 0:
   - Delete conversation document
   - Delete all messages in subcollection
   - Delete media from Storage
3. Else:
   - Keep conversation for remaining participants
```

**UI Flow:**
1. Swipe left on conversation → Delete button appears
2. Confirmation dialog with options:
   - "Delete for me" (default)
   - "Request delete for everyone" (requires agreement)
   - Cancel
3. If delete for me: Remove from participant list
4. If request for everyone: Send notification to all participants

**Storage Cleanup:**
- Cloud Function to delete orphaned media
- Runs when conversation is fully deleted
- Removes images, documents, voice messages from Storage

### Benefits
- **Privacy:** Remove sensitive conversations
- **Organization:** Clean up old/unused conversations
- **Storage:** Free up Firestore and Storage space
- **Expected feature:** Standard in messaging apps

### Estimated Implementation Time
- Swipe-to-delete UI: **1 hour**
- Delete logic (Firestore): **1 hour**
- Storage cleanup function: **30 minutes**
- Archive feature (optional): **30 minutes**
- Testing: **30 minutes**
- **Total: 2-3 hours** (add 1 hour for archive feature)

### Priority Justification
- **Nice-to-have:** Not critical for MVP
- **Future enhancement:** Can be added in v2.0
- **Complexity:** Requires careful handling of shared data
- **Alternative:** Manual cleanup by admin

### Related Code
- `app/(tabs)/conversations.tsx` - Add swipe-to-delete
- `src/services/firebase/firestore.ts` - Delete conversation function
- New Cloud Function: `functions/src/cleanup/deleteConversation.ts`

## 🐛 BUG-007: Inconsistent BACK Button Navigation from AI Features

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Category:** Navigation/UX  
**Status:** ⏸️ Deferred to Phase 4  
**Discovered:** October 23, 2025 (Phase 2.6 Integration Testing)  
**Test Case:** TC-INT-001

### Description
BACK button navigation is inconsistent when using AI features from different contexts. Navigation stack is not properly maintained.

### Steps to Reproduce

**Scenario 1 (Works Correctly):**
1. Search → Result → Conversation → BACK
2. Result: Returns to search results ✅

**Scenario 2 (Issue):**
1. Conversation → AI Summary/Action Items → BACK
2. Result: Goes to main Messages screen ❌
3. Expected: Should return to conversation

**Scenario 3 (Issue):**
1. Search → Result → Conversation → AI Summary → BACK
2. Result: Goes to main Messages screen ❌
3. Expected: Should return to conversation, then search results on second BACK

### Expected Behavior
- BACK button should always return to the previous screen in navigation stack
- Navigation context should be preserved across AI Assistant operations
- Consistent behavior regardless of how AI Assistant was accessed

### Actual Behavior
- BACK from AI Assistant always goes to main Messages screen
- Navigation stack is not preserved
- User loses context and has to manually navigate

### Impact
- **Severity:** Medium (UX issue)
- **User Impact:** Moderate - user loses navigation context
- **Frequency:** Every time AI features used from conversation
- **Workaround:** User can manually navigate back

### Technical Notes
- Need to implement navigation stack management
- Track where user came from before opening AI Assistant
- Options:
  1. Pass `source` param (conversation | search | main)
  2. Use React Navigation's `goBack()` with proper stack
  3. Implement custom back handler based on context

**Recommended Solution:**
```typescript
// Pass navigation source
navigation.navigate('AIAssistant', {
  source: 'conversation',
  conversationId: currentConversationId,
  returnTo: 'conversation', // where to go on BACK
});

// In AI Assistant, handle BACK
const handleBack = () => {
  if (route.params?.returnTo === 'conversation') {
    navigation.navigate('Conversation', {
      id: route.params.conversationId
