I'll help you create a new branch on your GitHub repo for the Gauntlet-Project-Two project.

I can see you're currently on the `PR1-INITIAL` branch with some uncommitted changes. I'll create the new branch "PR2 - MVP Complete (Phase 1A)" from the current state. The uncommitted changes will carry over to the new branch.

I see two issues: we're already in the directory, and Git doesn't allow spaces and parentheses in branch names. Let me create the branch with a valid name format:

Perfect! The branch has been created locally. Now let me push it to GitHub:

âœ… Successfully created and pushed the branch to GitHub!

**Branch name:** `PR2-MVP-Complete-Phase-1A`

Note: Git doesn't allow spaces or parentheses in branch names, so I used hyphens instead. The branch is now:
- Created locally
- Pushed to your GitHub repository
- Set up with tracking to the remote

You're currently on this new branch, and your uncommitted changes (including the MVP-FINAL-STATUS.md file) are ready to be committed to this branch whenever you're ready.
