## 🐛 FUNCTIONAL BUGS (Priority Ordered)

---

### Bug #1: Multi-Select Shapes Disappear (Handles Remain Visible)
**Priority:** 🟠 **High**  
**Status:** Deferred to Phase 6 (Maintenance)  
**Category:** Multi-Selection / Canvas Rendering  
**Discovered:** October 19, 2025 (Phase 4b testing)  

**Description:**
When multiple shapes are selected (Shift+click or Cmd+click), the selected shapes visually disappear from the canvas, but transform handles remain visible.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create 2+ shapes on canvas
2. Select first shape (click)
3. Hold Shift/Cmd and click second shape
4. Observe: shapes disappear but transform handles remain visible

**Expected Behavior:**
- All selected shapes remain visible with blue outline/glow
- Transform handles show bounding box of selection
- Shapes stay opaque and selectable

**Actual Behavior:**
- Selected shapes become invisible/transparent
- Only handles are visible
- User cannot see what they're selecting

**Impact:**
- Critical for multi-select UX
- User loses visual feedback
- Confusing interaction pattern

**Root Cause:** Likely z-index or opacity issue during multi-select state change

**Fix Approach:**
- Check Canvas.tsx for multi-select rendering logic
- Verify shape components don't hide when `isSelected` is true with multiple selections
- May need to add multi-select state to shape components

**Files Affected:**
- `src/components/Canvas.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useShapes.ts`
- Shape components (Rectangle, Circle, Text, Line, Arrow)

**Demo Impact:** Medium
- This is the original "Bug #1" from Phase 4b
- Significant UX issue but has workarounds
- Avoid demonstrating multi-select with shift-click in demo (use individual operations)

**Fix Estimate:** 30-45 minutes

**Assigned:** Phase 6 (Post-Submission Maintenance)

---

### Bug #2: User Cursor Tracking Not Visible
**Priority:** 🟡 **Medium**  
**Status:** Pre-existing (also broken in dev)  
**Category:** User Presence / Real-time Collaboration  
**Discovered:** October 20, 2025 (Production testing)  

**Description:**
User cursor tracking is not visible in either tab when testing real-time collaboration. The presence system shows "👥 Visible users: 2" in console logs, but the cursor overlay is not rendering.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open app in 2 browser tabs
2. Log in to both tabs
3. Move cursor in Tab 1
4. Observe Tab 2 - no cursor appears

**Expected Behavior:**
- Other user's cursor should appear with label/initials
- Cursor should follow movements in real-time
- Different colors for different users

**Actual Behavior:**
- Presence system detects users (console: "👥 Visible users: 2")
- No cursor overlay visible on canvas
- Data tracked but not displayed

**Console Evidence:**
```
✅ User presence initialized: VAxIkpyUFbRSzWfglwUHjyiXrcs2
✅ Presence initialized
💓 Starting presence heartbeat
👥 Visible users: 2
```

**Impact:**
- Reduces collaboration awareness
- Users can't see where others are working
- Core sync features still work

**Root Cause:** Likely rendering layer issue - presence data tracked but not displayed

**Demo Impact:** Low
- Core collaboration features work (shape sync)
- Can mention in demo as "coming soon feature"
- Or simply don't mention cursor tracking

**Fix Estimate:** 2-3 hours

**Assigned:** Phase 6 (Post-Submission Maintenance)

### Bug #3: Multi-Select Group Drag Only Moves One Shape
**Priority:** 🟡 **Medium**  
**Status:** Pre-existing (existed before deployment)  
**Category:** Multi-Select / Group Operations  
**Discovered:** October 20, 2025 (Production testing)  

**Description:**
When multiple shapes are selected (via Shift+Click) and user attempts to drag them, only the actively dragged shape moves. The rest of the selected shapes remain in place.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create 3+ shapes on canvas
2. Select multiple shapes using Shift+Click
3. All shapes highlight as selected
4. Drag one of the selected shapes
5. Observe: Only the dragged shape moves

**Expected Behavior:**
- All selected shapes should move together as a group
- Relative positions maintained
- Group moves in unison with drag

**Actual Behavior:**
- Only the directly dragged shape moves
- Other selected shapes stay in original positions
- Selection remains active on non-moved shapes

**Related Working Features:**
- ✅ Multi-select delete WORKS correctly (all selected shapes delete)
- ✅ Multi-select undo WORKS correctly (all shapes restored)

**Impact:**
- Reduces multi-select utility
- Users expect group drag to work
- Workaround: move shapes individually

**Root Cause:** Group transform logic not applied to drag handler

**Demo Impact:** Low-Medium
- Can demonstrate multi-select delete (which works)
- Avoid demonstrating multi-select drag
- Or mention as "individual shape precision" feature

**Fix Estimate:** 3-4 hours (implement group transform on drag)

**Assigned:** Phase 6 (Post-Submission Maintenance)

---

### Bug #4: Incomplete Undo/Redo History
**Priority:** 🟡 **Medium**  
**Status:** Pre-existing (early development stage)  
**Category:** Undo/Redo System  
**Discovered:** October 20, 2025 (Production testing)  

**Description:**
Not all shape operations are being logged to the undo/redo history. Some actions can be undone, others cannot.

**Observations:**
- ✅ Create shape → Can undo
- ✅ Delete shape(s) → Can undo
- ❓ Move shape → Inconsistent undo
- ❓ Resize shape → May not undo
- ❓ Rotate shape → May not undo
- ❓ AI commands → Inconsistent undo

**Expected Behavior:**
- All shape-modifying actions logged to history
- Consistent undo/redo for all operations
- History persists across session

**Actual Behavior:**
- Some operations logged, others missed
- Undo works for create/delete
- Transform operations may not be in history

**Impact:**
- Inconsistent user experience
- Users expect all operations to be undoable
- Can work around by manually reverting changes

**Root Cause:** Action logging not comprehensive across all handlers

**Demo Impact:** Low
- Undo/redo demonstrated working (for delete)
- Simply avoid undoing transforms in demo
- Focus on successful undo use cases

**Fix Estimate:** 4-5 hours (audit all handlers, add logging)

**Assigned:** Phase 6 (Post-Submission Maintenance)

### Bug #8: Canvas Drawing Area Doesn't Match Window Size
**Priority:** 🟡 **Medium**  
**Status:** Layout/Viewport Issue  
**Category:** Canvas Rendering / Responsive Design  
**Discovered:** October 20, 2025 (Production testing)  

**Description:**
The drawable canvas area does not properly fill or align with the viewport/window size. This results in UI elements like the logout button being only partially visible or cut off.

**Visual Evidence:**
- Logout button rendered partially (cut off)
- Canvas boundaries not aligned with viewport
- Suggests canvas size calculation issue

**Current Behavior:**
- Canvas rendered at fixed or incorrectly calculated dimensions
- Does not respond to window resize properly
- Toolbar/UI elements positioned assuming different canvas size

**Expected Behavior:**
- Canvas fills available viewport space
- Proper margins/padding for UI elements
- All toolbar buttons fully visible
- Responsive to window resize

**Impact:**
- UI elements partially hidden
- Unprofessional appearance
- May hide important controls
- Affects user experience on different screen sizes

**Root Cause:** Likely viewport/canvas size calculation in initial render

**Demo Impact:** Medium
- Visible in recordings
- Should be fixed for professional appearance
- **Workaround:** Use full-screen mode or specific window size during recording (1920x1080 recommended)

**Fix Estimate:** 1-2 hours (viewport calculation + responsive handlers)

**Assigned:** Phase 6 (Post-Submission Maintenance)

### Bug #5: SVG Export Outputs White Page
**Priority:** 🟢 **Low**  
**Status:** Newly discovered  
**Category:** Export Functionality  
**Discovered:** October 20, 2025 (Production testing)  

**Description:**
When exporting canvas as SVG, the output file contains only a white page. PNG export works correctly at all resolutions.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create shapes on canvas
2. Click "Export" button
3. Select SVG format
4. Download file
5. Open SVG file → Only white background visible

**Expected Behavior:**
- SVG export includes all shapes
- Vector graphics properly encoded
- Shapes match canvas content

**Actual Behavior:**
- SVG file generated (12 lines)
- Contains only white background rectangle
- No shape data included

**SVG File Content Example:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
     width="2020" height="2020" viewBox="0 0 2020 2020">
  <title>CollabCanvas Export</title>
  <desc>Exported from CollabCanvas</desc>
  <g id="background">
    <rect x="0" y="0" width="2020" height="2020" fill="#ffffff"/>
  </g>
  <g id="shapes">
    <rect x="0" y="0" width="2000" height="2000" fill="#ffffff" stroke="#e5e7eb" stroke-width="2"/>
  </g>
</svg>
```

**Working Alternative:**
- ✅ PNG export fully functional
- ✅ Multiple resolutions supported
- ✅ PNG sufficient for demo purposes

**Impact:**
- Low (PNG export works fine)
- SVG is nice-to-have feature
- Most users prefer PNG anyway

**Root Cause:** SVG serialization logic not capturing Konva shapes

**Demo Impact:** None
- Demonstrate PNG export only
- PNG is more commonly used anyway
- No need to mention SVG at all

**Fix Estimate:** 2-3 hours (implement proper SVG shape serialization)

**Assigned:** Phase 6 (Post-Submission Maintenance)

### Bug #6: Marquee Box Selection Not Implemented
**Priority:** 🟢 **Low**  
**Status:** Feature not yet implemented  
**Category:** Selection / UX Enhancement  
**Discovered:** October 20, 2025 (Production testing)  

**Description:**
Marquee box selection (click-drag on empty canvas to create selection rectangle) is not implemented. However, Shift+Click multi-select works as alternative.

**Current Behavior:**
- Click-drag on empty canvas → No marquee box appears
- Cannot select multiple shapes by dragging box around them

**Working Alternative:**
- ✅ Shift+Click on shapes → Multi-select works
- ✅ Multiple shapes can be selected
- ✅ Visual feedback (all selected shapes highlighted)
- ✅ Delete multiple selected shapes works

**Expected Behavior (Future):**
- Click-drag on empty canvas creates blue selection box
- All shapes within box are selected when released
- Provides intuitive multi-select UX

**Impact:**
- Low (alternative method works)
- Shift+Click is professional interaction pattern
- Marquee is "nice to have" not "must have"

**Note:** This is a feature gap, not a bug. Not originally scoped for MVP.

**Demo Impact:** None
- Shift+Click is professional interaction pattern
- Can demonstrate multi-select with Shift+Click
- Marquee is standard in design tools but not critical

**Implementation Estimate:** 3-4 hours (if desired for polish)

**Assigned:** Future Enhancement (Post-MVP)

### Bug #7: AI Window Covers User List and Toasts
**Priority:** 🟢 **Low**  
**Status:** UI/UX Layout Issue  
**Category:** User Interface / Layout  
**Discovered:** October 20, 2025 (Production testing)  

**Description:**
The AI Canvas Agent panel, when open, overlays and obscures the user list and toast notifications in the top-right corner of the interface.

**Impact:**
- Users cannot see active users when AI panel is open
- Toast notifications (success/error messages) are hidden
- Must close AI panel to view user list
- Reduces awareness of collaboration state

**Current Behavior:**
- AI panel opens as floating overlay
- Positioned over top-right UI elements
- Z-index higher than user list/toasts

**Suggested Fix:**
- Move AI panel to left sidebar layout
- Part of future UX upgrade/redesign
- Alternative: Reduce AI panel width or reposition

**Demo Impact:** Low
- Can demonstrate AI without user list visible
- Simply avoid showing both simultaneously
- Or mention as "optimized for focused AI interaction"

**Implementation Estimate:** 2-3 hours (full sidebar redesign)

**Assigned:** Phase 6 (Post-Submission UX Polish)

### Bug #9: Shape Selection Color Uses Shape Theme Instead of User Color
**Priority:** 🟢 **Low**  
**Status:** UX/Visual Feedback Issue  
**Category:** Selection Indication / Collaboration UX  
**Discovered:** October 20, 2025 (Production testing)  

**Description:**
When a shape is selected, the selection outline/border is drawn in the color of the shape's fill/theme rather than the user's assigned color. In a collaborative environment, selection should indicate WHO has selected the shape, not what color the shape is.

**Current Behavior:**
- Select a blue rectangle → blue selection outline
- Select a red circle → red selection outline
- Selection color matches shape color

**Expected Behavior (Collaborative UX):**
- Select any shape → outline in User 1's color (e.g., purple)
- User 2 selects shape → outline in User 2's color (e.g., orange)
- Selection color indicates which user has the shape selected
- Critical for multi-user awareness

**Rationale:**
- In Figma/Miro/collaborative tools, selection shows user identity
- Helps users see "who is editing what"
- Prevents collision (editing same shape simultaneously)
- Current implementation loses collaborative context

**Impact:**
- Confusing in multi-user scenarios
- Cannot tell which user selected which shape
- Reduces collaboration awareness
- Works fine for single-user usage

**Demo Impact:** Low
- Single-user demo doesn't highlight the issue
- Can demonstrate without mentioning
- Or pitch as "shape-aware selection highlighting"

**Fix Estimate:** 1-2 hours (update selection stroke color logic)

**Assigned:** Phase 6 (Post-Submission UX Polish)

### ⚠️ Minor Issue: Quirks Mode Warning
**Priority:** Very Low  
**Status:** Console warning  
**Category:** HTML/Document Structure  
**Discovered:** October 20, 2025 (Production testing)  

**Console Warning:**
```
This page is in Quirks Mode. Page layout may be impacted. 
For Standards Mode use "<!DOCTYPE html>".
```

**Description:**
Missing DOCTYPE declaration in HTML causes browser to render in Quirks Mode instead of Standards Mode.

**Impact:** 
- No visible rendering issues
- App functions perfectly
- Modern CSS/JS still work
- Just a best practice violation

**Fix:** Add `<!DOCTYPE html>` to `index.html` (30 seconds)

**Demo Impact:** None (not user-visible)

**Fix Estimate:** 30 seconds

**Assigned:** Quick fix (can be done anytime)

## 🎬 DEMO VIDEO STRATEGY

### ✅ Features to Showcase (All Working!)
1. **5 Shape Types** - Create all 5 (Rectangle, Circle, Line, Arrow, Text)
2. **AI Canvas Agent** - Execute 3-5 natural language commands
3. **Shape Transforms** - Drag, resize (8-point handles), rotate
4. **Real-time Sync** - Show 2 browser tabs, create shapes, watch sync
5. **Multi-Select** - Use Shift+Click, delete multiple shapes
6. **Undo/Redo** - Undo deletion of shapes (works!)
7. **Export** - Download PNG at high resolution
8. **Performance** - Emphasize smooth 60 FPS experience

### ❌ Features to Avoid (Due to Bugs)
1. **Don't show:** Multi-select causing shapes to disappear (Bug #1)
2. **Don't show:** User cursor tracking (Bug #2 - not visible)
3. **Don't show:** Multi-select drag (Bug #3 - only moves one)
4. **Don't show:** Undo transforms (Bug #4 - inconsistent)
5. **Don't show:** SVG export (Bug #5 - use PNG only)
6. **Don't show:** Marquee box (Bug #6 - not implemented)

### ⚠️ Recording Considerations
- **Bug #8 (Viewport):** Use full-screen browser mode or 1920x1080 resolution to ensure all UI elements visible
- **Bug #7 (AI Panel):** Close AI panel when showcasing user list/collaboration
- **Bug #9 (Selection Color):** Single-user demo won't highlight this issue
- **Bug #1 (Multi-select disappear):** Test before recording to ensure it doesn't show up

### 💡 Demo Workarounds
- **For Multi-Select:** Use Shift+Click, then delete ONLY (avoid other operations that trigger Bug #1)
- **For Collaboration:** Show shape sync, mention "coming soon: cursor tracking"
- **For Undo:** Demonstrate with create/delete only (avoid transform undo)
- **For Export:** PNG is professional standard, no need to mention SVG
- **For Selection:** Shift+Click is standard UX pattern in design tools
- **For Viewport:** Record in maximized browser window at 1920x1080
