## 🎯 CRITICAL DECISION: What to Build

### **Option A: Focus on MVP Essentials (Recommended)**

**Core MVP Only (8 hours):**
1. ✅ Messaging (DONE)
2. ✅ Real-time sync (DONE)
3. Phase 1.8: Basic offline persistence (1.5h) - Simplified
4. Phase 1.9: Optimistic UI (1h) - Basic version
5. Phase 1.11: Image messaging (1.5h) - Required ⭐
6. Phase 1.12: Profile pictures (1h) - Required ⭐
7. Phase 1.13: Typing indicators (1h) - Required ⭐
8. Phase 1.15: Basic group chat (2h) - Simplified

**Total:** ~8 hours + 2h buffer = **10 hours** ✅ Achievable!

**Skip for now:**
- Advanced offline queue (complex)
- Online/offline status (nice-to-have)
- Read receipts (can add later)
- Push notifications setup (complex)
- Message timestamps (minor)

---

### **Option B: Try to Do Everything (Risky)**

**All Planned Features (14-16 hours):**
- Everything from Option A
- Plus: Full offline queue, online status, receipts, notifications
- **Risk:** Won't finish, spread too thin
- **Result:** Incomplete features = lower grade

---

### **Option C: Minimum Viable (Conservative)**

**Bare Minimum (6 hours):**
1. ✅ Messaging (DONE)
2. ✅ Real-time sync (DONE)  
3. Basic persistence (1h) - Just Firestore offline
4. Image messaging (1.5h) - Required ⭐
5. Profile pictures (1h) - Required ⭐
6. Typing indicators (1h) - Required ⭐
7. Group chat (1.5h) - Very basic

**Total:** ~6 hours, leaves 4h for polish/testing
