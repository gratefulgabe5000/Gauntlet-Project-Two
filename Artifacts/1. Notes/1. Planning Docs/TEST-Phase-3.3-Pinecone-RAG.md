# Phase 3.3 Test Plan: Semantic Search with RAG (Pinecone)

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Phase:** 3.3 - Semantic Search with RAG  
**Status:** ‚è≥ Ready for Testing

---

## üéØ Test Objectives

1. ‚úÖ Verify Pinecone integration is working
2. ‚úÖ Confirm automatic message indexing on new messages
3. ‚úÖ Test migration of existing messages to Pinecone
4. ‚úÖ Validate vector search returns semantically relevant results
5. ‚úÖ Ensure backward compatibility with keyword search fallback

---

## üß™ Test Cases

### **TEST 1: TC-RAG-001 - Verify Pinecone Connection**

**Objective:** Confirm Cloud Functions can connect to Pinecone

**Steps:**
1. Open Firebase Console
2. Go to Functions logs
3. Look for "Pinecone client initialized" logs after deployment

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ No errors about Pinecone API key or connection
- ‚úÖ Functions successfully initialize Pinecone client

**Actual Result:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### **TEST 2: TC-RAG-002 - Automatic Message Indexing**

**Objective:** New messages are automatically indexed to Pinecone

**Steps:**
1. Open MessageAI app
2. Send a new message in any conversation: "Machine learning is transforming healthcare"
3. Wait 5-10 seconds
4. Check Firebase Functions logs for `onMessageCreatedIndexing`

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Log shows "Indexing message to Pinecone"
- ‚úÖ Log shows "Message indexed to Pinecone successfully"
- ‚úÖ Log shows embedding dimensions: 1536
- ‚úÖ No errors

**Actual Result:** ‚è≥ Pending

**Questions:**
- Did the indexing trigger fire? (Yes/No):
- Any errors in logs? (Yes/No):
- Embedding dimensions correct? (Yes/No):

---

### **TEST 3: TC-RAG-003 - Migrate Existing Messages**

**Objective:** Backfill existing messages to Pinecone

**Pre-requisite:** Must have at least 5-10 existing messages in conversations

**Steps:**
1. We'll call the `migrateMessagesToPinecone` function from the AI Assistant
2. Check the response for:
   - Number of messages indexed
   - Number skipped (encrypted)
   - Any failures
3. Check Firebase logs for migration progress

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Migration completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Non-encrypted messages are indexed
- ‚úÖ Encrypted messages are skipped
- ‚úÖ Very short messages (<5 chars) are skipped
- ‚úÖ Index stats show increased vector count

**Actual Result:** ‚è≥ Pending

**Questions:**
- How many messages were indexed?:
- How many were skipped?:
- Any failures?:

---

### **TEST 4: TC-RAG-004 - Semantic Search (Synonyms)**

**Objective:** Vector search finds semantically similar messages (not just exact keywords)

**Pre-requisite:** Send these test messages first:
1. "Let's have a call tomorrow at 2pm"
2. "We should schedule a meeting next week"
3. "Can we sync up about the project?"
4. "The weather is nice today"
5. "What's your favorite food?"

**Steps:**
1. Open AI Assistant tab
2. Search for: "discussion"
3. Review results

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Results include messages with "call", "meeting", "sync" (synonyms of discussion)
- ‚úÖ Results do NOT include "weather" or "food" (semantically unrelated)
- ‚úÖ Results are ranked by relevance score
- ‚úÖ "expandedQuery" shows "Vector Search (RAG)" not keyword terms

**Actual Result:** ‚è≥ Pending

**Questions:**
- Did it find the "call", "meeting", "sync" messages? (Yes/No):
- Did it exclude unrelated messages? (Yes/No):
- Are results ranked by relevance? (Yes/No):
- Does it say "Vector Search (RAG)"? (Yes/No):

---

### **TEST 5: TC-RAG-005 - Semantic Search (Concepts)**

**Objective:** Vector search understands concepts, not just words

**Pre-requisite:** Send these test messages:
1. "The AI model achieved 95% accuracy"
2. "Machine learning algorithms are improving"
3. "Neural networks can detect patterns"
4. "I'm making spaghetti for dinner"
5. "The cat is sleeping on the couch"

**Steps:**
1. Search for: "artificial intelligence"
2. Review results

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Results include messages about "AI", "machine learning", "neural networks"
- ‚úÖ Results do NOT include "spaghetti" or "cat" messages
- ‚úÖ Relevance scores are high for AI-related messages (>0.7)

**Actual Result:** ‚è≥ Pending

**Questions:**
- Did it find AI-related messages? (Yes/No):
- Did it exclude unrelated messages? (Yes/No):
- Are relevance scores >0.7 for matches? (Yes/No):

---

### **TEST 6: TC-RAG-006 - Search Encrypted Messages**

**Objective:** Encrypted messages are NOT indexed and NOT searchable

**Pre-requisite:** Send an encrypted message containing unique text: "This is my secret password 12345"

**Steps:**
1. Verify the message shows üîí icon in conversation
2. Search for: "secret password"
3. Review results

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Encrypted message does NOT appear in search results
- ‚úÖ No errors thrown
- ‚úÖ Privacy is maintained

**Actual Result:** ‚è≥ Pending

**Questions:**
- Was the encrypted message excluded from results? (Yes/No):
- Any errors? (Yes/No):

---

### **TEST 7: TC-RAG-007 - Fallback to Keyword Search**

**Objective:** If Pinecone fails, system falls back to keyword search gracefully

**Note:** This is difficult to test without intentionally breaking Pinecone. We'll just verify logs show the fallback logic exists.

**Steps:**
1. Review Cloud Functions logs for any Pinecone errors
2. If an error occurred, verify it says "falling back to keyword search"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ System handles Pinecone failures gracefully
- ‚úÖ Search still returns results using keyword fallback
- ‚úÖ No app crashes

**Actual Result:** ‚è≥ Pending (Can only verify if error occurs)

---

### **TEST 8: TC-RAG-008 - Performance Check**

**Objective:** Vector search is fast and doesn't timeout

**Steps:**
1. Perform a search query
2. Note the response time

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Search completes in < 3 seconds
- ‚úÖ No timeout errors

**Actual Result:** ‚è≥ Pending

**Questions:**
- Response time (seconds):
- Any timeouts? (Yes/No):
