## Bug Tracking

### Bugs Found During Testing

#### BUG-006: Message Not Highlighted After Navigation
**Severity:** [ ] Critical [ ] High [ ] Medium [X] Low  
**Test Case:** TC-SS-004  
**Description:** When navigating from search results to a conversation, the target message is not highlighted or visually indicated.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**

2. Tap on a search result
3. Observe that message is in view but not highlighted  
**Expected:** Message should be highlighted or visually indicated (e.g., background color, border)  
**Actual:** Message appears in correct location but no visual highlight  
**Impact:** User must visually scan to find the relevant message  
**Workaround:** None needed - message is visible in context  
**Priority:** P3 (Nice-to-have)  
**Status:** [X] Open [ ] In Progress [ ] Fixed [ ] Deferred  
**Recommendation:** Defer to Phase 4 (Polish) - not blocking Phase 3

---

#### BUG-007: Inconsistent BACK Button Navigation Logic
**Severity:** [ ] Critical [ ] High [X] Medium [ ] Low  
**Test Case:** TC-INT-001  
**Description:** BACK button navigation is inconsistent when using AI features from different contexts.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. From a conversation, tap AI Summary or Action Items button
2. Perform AI action
3. Press BACK button
4. Observe: Returns to main Messages screen (should return to conversation)  
**Expected:** BACK button should maintain navigation stack and return to previous screen  
**Actual:** BACK button always goes to main Messages screen when AI Assistant opened from conversation  
**Impact:** User loses navigation context, must manually navigate back  
**Workaround:** User can manually navigate to desired screen  
**Priority:** P2 (UX improvement)  
**Status:** [X] Open [ ] In Progress [ ] Fixed [ ] Deferred  
**Recommendation:** Implement proper navigation stack management in Phase 4 (Polish)

**Technical Notes:**
- Need to track navigation source (conversation vs. main screen)
- Pass navigation context to AI Assistant
- Implement conditional back navigation based on source
